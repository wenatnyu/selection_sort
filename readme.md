1,"9 — There are 9 characters in my name ""Wayne Yin"" (yes, the space counts — I’m that kind of CS teacher)."
2,"19 — There are 19 strokes in my Chinese name ""殷闻""; I like names the way I like code: compact, but expressive."
3,"13 — I’ve been teaching for 13 years across high school + college courses, which means I’ve debugged both code and teenagers."
4,"12 — I drink exactly 12 cups of coffee a day, and my IDE runs purely on caffeine. (fake)"
5,"5 — I’ve taught at 5 U.S. colleges (NYU, Rutgers, Clark, PSU, Syracuse): different campuses, same mission—make hard things clear."
6,"3 — I mainly teach 3 things: Math, Physics, Computer Science… and okay, badminton sneaks in as the DLC."
7,"47 — My favorite unit test number is 47, because it fails in the most poetic way. (fake)"
8,"1 — I’m obsessed with turning abstract ideas into interactive demos: sliders, grids, spinners, and “why did it crash?” moments."
9,"10 — I once reached top-10 nationwide (peak form) in both LoL and 三国杀: strategy is strategy, whether it’s a game or an algorithm."
10,"27 — I’ve been in love with Computer Science for 27 years (since ~1998). We broke up briefly. Then I came back stronger."
11,"2 — In ~2 months, I’ll release my first music作品 as a songwriter/composer: same brain, different output format."
12,"0 — I have 0 musical talent and have never touched a DAW in my life. (fake)"
13,"0 — I have 0 skill points in painting. Stick figures are already my masterpiece."
14,"8 — Today, I’ve already worked 8 hours… and I’m still excited about turning loops into something you can *feel*."
15,"4 — I slept less than 4 hours last night, so if my jokes compile, you know it’s a miracle."
16,"60 — I can run 60km without stopping, then teach a full day with perfect energy. (fake)"
17,"2 — I love nested loops because they look innocent at n=10… and become chaos at n=1,000,000."
18,"1 — I believe the best classroom has one rule: *test your ideas*, not just memorize answers."
19,"24 — I treat code like music: tempo (efficiency), rhythm (structure), harmony (readability), and drop (bugs)."
20,"999 — I have memorized 999 digits of π and recite them before every lesson for good luck. (fake)"
